# A12 Interpreter releases

This repository is the public distribution of the independent, kernel-free A12 Document Model interpreter. Development happens in the main [`a12-dmkits` project](https://github.com/mbackschat/a12-dmkits); this mirror contains immutable release assets, the cumulative Maven repository, versioned API references, and the browser showcase.

> **Independent project.** This is not an official A12 or mgm artifact.

## What ships

- Finite in-memory workspaces and on-demand model providers
- Self-contained model expansion, separate from evaluator preparation
- Lossless, versioned Document JSON with structured input diagnostics
- Deterministic model-shaped Document seeds containing every declared group and field
- Full and partial validation, retained computation application, support reports, and model-owned pointers
- Canonical A12 `DocumentPointer` formatting and parsing, so a repeated computed row is separately addressable
- Synchronous custom field validators and custom conditions
- Thread-safe model reuse: one prepared model serves concurrent requests, each with its own interpreter
- Explicit resource limits, integrity checks, cancellation, and prepared models that are immutable to callers
- The same Kotlin implementation on JVM, Node.js, and browser targets

The package does not author models, render forms, persist Documents, provide a virtual filesystem, or bundle Kernel code. Kernel-shaped TypeScript and JVM drop-in adapters are separate, later compatibility products.

**Semantics target.** This release reproduces the evaluation behavior of **A12 Kernel 30.8.1**, as shipped in the **A12 Tools 2025.06-ext5** distribution. The implementation is clean-room and is verified by differential testing against that kernel; the target version is stated so you can tell which kernel's semantics a given release was matched to.

## Performance

**[→ Performance and footprint](PERFORMANCE.md)** — what the package costs to ship, how fast it validates in the browser and on the JVM, what a resident model costs, and how each figure was measured.

## TypeScript and JavaScript

Install the npm-compatible tarball directly from the GitHub Release:

```sh
pnpm add https://github.com/mbackschat/a12-interpreter-releases/releases/download/v0.13.0/a12-interpreter-0.13.0.tgz
```

Documents are A12's own Document JSON — the shape the A12 Kernel serializes: a nested object tree, a repeating group as an array whose index is the repetition, native JSON for numbers and booleans.

Keep the prepared model and interpreter when a form validates repeated edits; read a new immutable Document snapshot for each change.

The Document shown below is decoded against the prepared model before evaluation. When its structure is not yet known, `prepared.documents.seedDocument()` creates a best-effort candidate with every declared group and field and one row per repeatable group; computation-owned targets remain present-empty for the engine to fill.

<!-- snippet: interpreter-typescript-start -->
```ts
import {
  type DocumentSnapshot,
  type Interpreter,
  ModelWorkspace,
  type A12Document,
} from "@mbackschat/a12-interpreter";

export function runInterpreter(rawModelJson: string) {
  const workspace = ModelWorkspace.fromSources([{json: rawModelJson}]);
  const prepared = workspace.prepare("permit-basic");
  const starter = prepared.documents.encodeDocument(
    prepared.documents.seedDocument(),
  );
  const input: A12Document = {
    Permit: {ApplicationNo: "P-42", RequestedArea: 120},
  };
  const document = prepared.documents.readDocument(input);
  const interpreter = prepared.createInterpreter();
  const relevant = prepared.model.relevantPointer(
    "/Permit/RequestedArea",
    [1, 1],
  );

  return {
    full: interpreter.validateFull(document),
    partial: interpreter.validatePart(document, [relevant]),
    computation: interpreter.compute(document),
    starter,
    document,
    prepared,
  };
}
```

`interpreter.compute(source)` returns report-all `results`, target diagnostics for ERRORED results, eager `formalErrorsInOperands`, Kernel-equivalent `noErrorOccurred`, and source-relative `actions`. Retain that report and call `applyTo(destination)` to apply it without recomputing; source and destination must belong to the same `PreparedModel`. `unsupported` remains an independent support axis. `interpreter.applyComputations(source)` is the same-document convenience. Every snapshot remains immutable.

The ordinary form-engine sequence is explicit and Kernel-shaped: `const computation = interpreter.compute(document); const applied = computation.applyTo(document); const validation = interpreter.validateFull(applied);`. The form retains `applied`.

## Kotlin and Java

Resolve the first-party publication from this repository's [GitHub Pages Maven repository](https://mbackschat.github.io/a12-interpreter-releases/maven/). Third-party Kotlin dependencies continue to resolve from Maven Central.

```gradle
repositories {
    maven("https://mbackschat.github.io/a12-interpreter-releases/maven")
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    implementation("io.github.mbackschat.a12.dm:dm-interpreter:0.13.0")
}
```

Java callers use the same JVM artifact; `ModelWorkspaceJava.collect` projects asynchronous model providers through `CompletionStage`.

The Kotlin and Java surface has the same shape as the TypeScript one: prepare a workspace, read a Document against the prepared model, then create an interpreter and ask it for validation or computation. The differences are idiomatic rather than structural — model sources are assembled through a typed builder, and `readDocument` takes A12 Document JSON as text.

<!-- snippet: interpreter-kotlin-start -->
```kotlin
import io.github.mbackschat.a12.dm.interpreter.ComputationReport
import io.github.mbackschat.a12.dm.interpreter.ModelWorkspace
import io.github.mbackschat.a12.dm.interpreter.ValidationReport
import io.github.mbackschat.a12.dm.interpreter.WorkspaceModelSource

data class InterpreterResult(
    val starterJson: String,
    val validation: ValidationReport,
    val computation: ComputationReport,
)

fun runInterpreter(modelJson: String): InterpreterResult {
    val source = WorkspaceModelSource.builder().json(modelJson).build()
    val prepared = ModelWorkspace.fromSources(listOf(source)).prepare("permit-basic")
    val starterJson = prepared.documents.encodeDocument(prepared.documents.seedDocument())
    val document = prepared.documents.readDocument(
        """{"Permit":{"ApplicationNo":"P-42","RequestedArea":120}}""",
    )
    val interpreter = prepared.createInterpreter()
    return InterpreterResult(
        starterJson = starterJson,
        validation = interpreter.validateFull(document),
        computation = interpreter.compute(document),
    )
}
```

`ValidationReport` and `ComputationReport` carry the same information as their TypeScript counterparts, including the model-owned pointers that tell apart the rows of a computation inside a repeatable group. Java consumers use these same types directly; a worked Java example lives in the developer API guide linked above.

One thing to carry over from *Server-side model cache* below: the `PreparedModel` returned by `prepare` is the expensive, reusable part and is safe to share across concurrent requests, while the `Interpreter` from `createInterpreter()` is per request. Retaining the prepared model and creating an interpreter per call is the intended pattern, not an optimization.

## Workspaces

`ModelWorkspace.fromSources` freezes a caller-supplied finite source set. `ModelWorkspace.collect` asks a caller-owned provider only for dependencies discovered from the entry model and loads each exact id at most once. Neither method performs implicit I/O.

`expand(entryModelId)` returns self-contained DM-JSON after resolving includes, imported type definitions, exclusions, ids, and cross-model references. `prepare(entryModelId)` continues through evaluator support checks and returns a reusable `PreparedModel`. Use `PreparedModel.loadExpandedJson` when that self-contained artifact is already available.

Preparation rejects ambiguous or incomplete workspaces instead of choosing a source-order winner. Errors carry stable structured diagnostics; provider exception messages, file paths, URLs, and credentials are not copied into them.

What matters for this repository is that the browser showcase uses that same public provider/workspace boundary. You can use its built-in examples or select your own local folder, model files, and Document; selected files remain in the browser.

## Server-side model cache

**A prepared model is shareable across concurrent requests; an interpreter is not.**

A `PreparedModel` owns everything derived from the model alone — condition and operation ASTs, iteration scopes,
uniqueness plans, the path index, the computation dependency order — memoized in thread-safe lazy state. One cache
entry therefore serves every tenant and every concurrent request for that model, whatever their configuration, and a
second interpreter over it performs no model-static work at all. In the shipped consumer example, 12 concurrent
requests across 4 threads over 3 models cost **3 preparations**.

An `Interpreter` is per request. That is a safety requirement, not a cost preference: it carries snapshot-scoped
state that custom conditions read, so sharing one across threads is unsupported.

Four things to know before sizing a cache:

- A resident prepared model is **larger than the DM-JSON it came from**, and the ratio moves with model SHAPE rather
  than size, so size the cache in **bytes, not entries**. The measured per-model cost and the structural budgeting
  rule are in [Performance and footprint](PERFORMANCE.md).
- An undersized cache is not slightly worse, it is no cache plus eviction overhead. The same 12 requests through a
  cache one entry too small cost **12 preparations and 10 evictions**.
- The cache is necessarily **in-process**: a prepared model is a live instance with a per-instance owner identity
  and no serialization, so only the expanded DM-JSON can live in a shared tier.

The complete pattern — cache keying, single-flight loading, eviction safety, and the trade-offs — is in
[the developer API guide](https://github.com/mbackschat/a12-interpreter-releases/blob/v0.13.0/site/api/v0.13.0/INTERPRETER-API-GUIDE.md).

## Compatibility and limits

The clean-room implementation is tested against the normative dynamic-Groovy Kernel strategy and against static Java wherever both Kernel strategies agree. JVM, Node.js, and packed-package Chrome consumers run the same portable behavior corpus.

The core is MIT-licensed and contains no Kernel bytecode or runtime dependency. Supported model time zones are `UTC`, `GMT`, and `Europe/Berlin`; all four A12 Date precisions are supported. `supportReport()` and the `unsupported` members on validation and computation results keep unsupported programs explicit; each entry's `subject` says whether it addresses a model element or a single Document cell.
