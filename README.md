# A12 Interpreter releases

This repository is the public distribution of the independent, kernel-free A12 Document Model interpreter. Development happens in the main [`a12-dmkits` project](https://github.com/mbackschat/a12-dmkits); this mirror contains immutable release assets, the cumulative Maven repository, versioned API references, and the browser showcase.

> **Independent project.** This is not an official A12 or mgm artifact.

## What ships

- Finite in-memory workspaces and on-demand model providers
- Include mounting, imported type definitions, id normalization, and cross-model reference remapping
- Self-contained expanded model output before evaluator-specific support checks
- Lossless, versioned Document JSON with structured input diagnostics
- Full and partial validation, computations, support reports, and model-owned pointers
- Custom field validators and custom conditions
- Thread-safe model reuse: one prepared model serves concurrent requests, each with its own interpreter
- Resource limits, source integrity, cancellation, and prepared models that are immutable to callers

The package performs no implicit filesystem, network, storage, or credential access. It contains no A12 Kernel bytecode or runtime dependency.

**Semantics target.** This release reproduces the evaluation behavior of **A12 Kernel 30.8.1**, as shipped in the **A12 Tools 2025.06-ext5** distribution. The implementation is clean-room and is verified by differential testing against that kernel; the target version is stated so you can tell which kernel's semantics a given release was matched to.

## Performance

**Fast, and measured — never assumed.**

The interpreter runs the same clean-room Kotlin implementation on the JVM, Node.js, and in the browser. The qualified browser package replays 33 portable conformance cases, and the [live showcase](https://mbackschat.github.io/a12-interpreter-releases/showcase/) proves the packed package in system Chrome rather than inferring browser support from Node.js.

The 0.13.0 showcase's measured production JavaScript entry is about **240 kB gzip**. On the fixed Apple M1/Chrome runner on 2026-08-03, a representative 200-row Document validated in a **10.5 ms median**; the 10,000-row stress Document validated with 4,900 findings in a **203.6 ms median**. Both figures use 10 independent fresh Chrome processes and include interpreter construction through complete result materialization.

The JVM comparison uses the A12 Kernel's generated validator compiled as Java, with code generation outside the clock, as the fair algorithmic baseline. In the 2026-08-03 sweep, the interpreter was **2.1× to 12.5× faster** across the 15-case default inventory and **10× to 16.7× faster** on repeated-document evaluation. The closest hostile point—384 concentrated low-firing rules—still led by **1.32×**, and the huge-document edge reached about **155×**. Neither generated Java nor dynamic Groovy won an eligible comparison in the default, repeated, rule-count, or 13-case edge suites. These are bounded same-machine measurements after exact result preflight, not universal promises; the scenarios, timing boundaries, and complete tables are documented in [Interpreter performance](https://github.com/mbackschat/a12-dmkits/blob/main/docs/INTERPRETER-PERFORMANCE.md).

Memory goes the same direction. On 2026-08-07, holding one prepared model resident on JDK 21 cost **3.8× to 9.2×** less than the equivalent generated-Java runtime service and **22× to 41×** less than the dynamic-Groovy one, across six models from type-definition-only to 192 rules, the last derived from a real model's shape. The Kernel's own expanded Document Model is comparable in size to a prepared model; what separates them is the generated rule and computation code — and a fifth to a half of that is class metadata in Metaspace, which a heap measurement does not see at all. The same three engines were first confirmed to produce identical findings over the identical document, so the comparison is between engines doing equal work. For sizing a model cache, a resident prepared model costs about **1.4 kB per field plus 1.55 kB per rule plus 2.3 kB per group**, within 4% across all six.

## TypeScript and JavaScript

Install the npm-compatible tarball directly from the GitHub Release:

```sh
pnpm add https://github.com/mbackschat/a12-interpreter-releases/releases/download/v0.13.0/a12-interpreter-0.13.0.tgz
```

```ts
import {
  ModelWorkspace,
  type A12Document,
} from "@mbackschat/a12-interpreter";

const workspace = ModelWorkspace.fromSources([{json: rawModelJson}]);
const prepared = workspace.prepare("permit-basic");
const input: A12Document = {
  Permit: {ApplicationNo: "P-42", RequestedArea: 120},
};
const document = prepared.documents.readDocument(input);
const result = prepared.createInterpreter().validateFull(document);
```

Documents are A12's own Document JSON — the shape the A12 Kernel serializes: a nested object tree, a repeating group as an array whose index is the repetition, native JSON for numbers and booleans.

Keep the prepared model and interpreter when a form validates repeated edits; read a new immutable Document snapshot for each change.

## Kotlin and Java

Resolve the first-party publication from this repository's [GitHub Pages Maven repository](https://mbackschat.github.io/a12-interpreter-releases/maven/). Third-party Kotlin dependencies continue to resolve from Maven Central.

```kotlin
repositories {
    maven("https://mbackschat.github.io/a12-interpreter-releases/maven")
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    implementation("io.github.mbackschat.a12.dm:dm-interpreter:0.13.0")
}
```

```kotlin
val source = WorkspaceModelSource.builder().json(rawModelJson).build()
val prepared = ModelWorkspace.fromSources(listOf(source)).prepare("permit-basic")
val document = prepared.documents.readDocument(
    """{"Permit":{"ApplicationNo":"P-42","RequestedArea":120}}""",
)
val report = prepared.createInterpreter().validateFull(document)
```

Java callers use the same JVM artifact; `ModelWorkspaceJava.collect` projects asynchronous model providers through `CompletionStage`.

## Workspaces

`ModelWorkspace.fromSources` freezes a caller-supplied finite source set. `ModelWorkspace.collect` asks a caller-owned provider only for dependencies discovered from the entry model and loads each exact id at most once.

`expand(entryModelId)` resolves includes and imported type definitions into self-contained DM-JSON. `prepare(entryModelId)` continues through evaluator support checks and returns a reusable `PreparedModel`. Ambiguous, cyclic, incomplete, oversized, or integrity-invalid workspaces fail with structured diagnostics rather than a source-order guess.

The browser showcase uses this same public provider/workspace boundary. You can use its built-in examples or select your own local folder, model files, and Document; selected files remain in the browser.
